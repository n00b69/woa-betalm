# Running Windows on the LG G8s

## Project status
Alpha. Some things work, some don't. Current main objective is to get charging and audio working.

There are currently issues with restarting/shutting down the device while in Windows, requiring you to force reboot using the power + volume down button. This will hopefully be fixed soon.

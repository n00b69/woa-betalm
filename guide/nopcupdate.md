# Running Windows on the LG G8s

## Updating drivers without a PC

### Prerequisites
- A rooted LG G8s with LineageOS 20 or an SD card

- [LG G8s WinInstaller](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-betalm/releases/download/Files/BetalmWinInstaller.zip)

- [Modified TWRP](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-betalm/releases/download/Files/modded-twrp-g8s-installer.zip)

### Notes
> [!WARNING]  
> 
> DO NOT REBOOT YOUR PHONE if you think you made a mistake, ask for help in the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/woahelperchat).

> [!Important]
> This guide assumes you have already installed Windows. If you haven't, use the [installation guide](nopc.md) instead.

### Preparing necessary files
- Download **WinInstaller.zip** and keep it in your **internal storage** (if you are using LineageOS 20), else, put it on your **micro SD card**.

### Flash the modified TWRP
> Or boot into TWRP if you've already installed it.
- In **Magisk**, select the **modded-twrp-g8s-installer.zip** and flash it.
- Return to the main menu, press the rotating arrow icon in the top right, and press `Reboot Recovery`.

### Flashing WinInstaller
- In TWRP, select **Install** and then locate **WinInstaller.zip** and flash it.
- Once you're given the option to reboot, do so.
> [!Note]
> Wait until all processes complete and your device boots back into Windows. This will take around 20-30 minutes.

## Finished!
